*Branch Author* Avnish Kamath (Swerve branch "avnish")
*Date of Commit* 12/4/2025

Changes Made By: Avnish Kamath
Description of Changes Made:
/*Since we inputted values ourself using the example YAGSL code, I decided to find the config file generator and then use that by putting data in, as it is more streamlined and also tells you what some of your types should be, and ours were not accurate.(Next I will fix the encoder offsets during session as YAGSL has a different system for them making our old code offsets inaccurate for this new library)*/
